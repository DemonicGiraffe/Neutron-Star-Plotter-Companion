# Neutron-Star-Plotter-Companion
A tiny compact program that uses Num1 &amp; Num2 (even when not focused) to automatically select and copy the next system on your route. it also keeps track of how many jumps are left on your trip!

# New Instructions as of ver 1.3 
Instead of downloading the CSV from https://www.spansh.co.uk/exact-plotter/ Select the whole chart from top to bottom and copy it.

Open Excel or Google Docs or some other Excel equivalent, and paste your data (without formatting)

Now Remove the colomn with the header "Done" and the last line with the text "Totals"

Make sure to save as **.csv** and you should be good to go.


As soon as the "Jumps Left" column is included in the export, ill update the app. Cheers!
